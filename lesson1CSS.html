  <h1>Learn CSS
    </h1>
  
  <p>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
    
    CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
    
    This tutorial will teach you CSS from basic to advanced</p>
  <h3>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</h3>

   <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
    <h4> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</h4>
   <h5></h5> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</h5>
  <h4>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</h4>

   <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    <h2>CSS selector</h2>
    
    <h4> selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</h4>
    
    <h4>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
    
    Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
    
    Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</h4>
    
   <h1> Example</h1>
   <h2> In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:</p></h2>
    
   <h4> p {
      color: red;
      text-align: center;
    }
    </h4>
<p>CSS Solved a Big Problem
  HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
  
  HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
  
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  
  When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
  
  To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
  
  CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
